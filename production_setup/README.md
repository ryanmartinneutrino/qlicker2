**Key components:**

| Service | Purpose | Exposed Ports |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| **Nginx** | TLS termination, reverse proxy, load balancing | 80, 443 |
| **Server** (Fastify) | REST API + WebSocket server | Internal only |
| **Client** (React SPA) | Static frontend served by internal Nginx | Internal only |
| **MongoDB** | Database | Internal only |
| **Redis** | WebSocket pub/sub for multi-instance sync | Internal only |
| **Certbot** (optional) | Automatic Let's Encrypt certificate renewal | None |

Only ports **80** and **443** are exposed to the host.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** ≥ 24.x with Docker Compose plugin (`docker compose`)
- **Domain name** pointing to the server's IP address
- **TLS certificate** (Let's Encrypt recommended, or bring your own)
- **SMTP server** for email features (password reset, email verification)
- At least **2 GB RAM** and **2 CPU cores** for a basic deployment

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Copy the production_setup directory to your server
scp -r production_setup/ user@server:/opt/qlicker/

# 2. SSH into the server
ssh user@server
cd /opt/qlicker

# 3. Run the interactive setup
chmod +x *.sh
./setup.sh

# 4. (Optional) Obtain Let's Encrypt certificate
./setup.sh --init-certs

# 5. Start the application
docker compose up -d

# 6. Check status
docker compose ps

# 7. View logs
docker compose logs -f
```

The first user to create an account via the web UI is automatically promoted to **admin**.

---

## Setup Script

The interactive `setup.sh` script generates the `.env` file with all required configuration:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

It will prompt for:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Domain | Your server's FQDN | `qlicker.example.com` |
| Server/client image tags | Tags applied to existing image repositories | `latest` (or current `.env` values) |
| App version label | Runtime release string shown in health checks and UI | `v2.0.0.b1` (or current `.env` value) |
| TLS certificate path | Path to fullchain.pem | `./certs/fullchain.pem` |
| TLS key path | Path to privkey.pem | `./certs/privkey.pem` |
| Let's Encrypt auto-renew | Whether certbot auto-renew runs in Docker | `false` (or current `.env` value) |
| Server replicas | Number of API server instances | `2` |
| JWT secrets | Auto-generated cryptographic secrets | (generated) |
| MAIL_URL | SMTP connection string | (none) |
| MongoDB admin username | Built-in MongoDB admin user | `qlickerAdmin` |
| MongoDB admin password | Built-in MongoDB admin password | (generated) |
| MONGO_URI | MongoDB connection URI | derived from the MongoDB admin credentials |
| Mongo cache size | WiredTiger cache in GB | `0.25` |
| Redis password | Built-in Redis password | (generated) |
| REDIS_URL | Redis connection URL | derived from `REDIS_PASSWORD` |
| Storage type | `local`, `s3`, or `azure` | `local` |
| Backup policy | Controlled in Admin -> Backup | `02:00` local, keep `7` daily / `4` weekly / `12` monthly |

Mongo tuning variables such as `MONGO_MAX_POOL_SIZE`,
`MONGO_SERVER_SELECTION_TIMEOUT_MS`, and retry settings are also carried
through from the existing `.env` or `.env.example` and written to the generated
`.env`, even though setup does not prompt for each of them individually.

### Configuration Inheritance

The setup script loads defaults from existing configuration files in priority order:

| Priority | Source | When used |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 (highest) | `production_setup/.env` | Re-running setup — all current production values are proposed as defaults |
| 2 | Root-level `.env` (dev config in `../`) | First-time production setup — inherits JWT secrets, MAIL_URL, storage, and other settings from dev |
| 3 (lowest) | `.env.example` | Fresh install — uses documented static defaults |

When an existing config is found, the script prints a summary of imported values. At each prompt the loaded default is shown in square brackets — press **Enter** to keep it, or type a new value to override.

### Re-running Setup

Running `./setup.sh` again will detect the existing `.env` and offer to keep current values as defaults. The generated `.env` is also written with mode `600` so database and Redis credentials stay host-local by default.

---

## TLS Certificates

### Option 1: Let's Encrypt (Recommended)

```bash
# Run interactive setup and choose:
#   2) Generate a Let's Encrypt certificate now
./setup.sh

# If you skip this during setup, you can run it later:
./setup.sh --init-certs
```

This will:
1. Create a temporary self-signed certificate
2. Start Nginx to handle the ACME challenge
3. Run Certbot to obtain the real certificate
4. Overwrite `./certs/fullchain.pem` and `./certs/privkey.pem` with the Let's Encrypt certificate files (setup warns before overwrite)
5. Keep `.env` paths set to `./certs/fullchain.pem` and `./certs/privkey.pem`
6. Optionally enable `CERTBOT_AUTORENEW=true` so the `certbot` service checks renewal every 12 hours

### Option 2: Bring Your Own Certificate

During setup, choose:

```bash
1) I already have certificate files (Let's Encrypt or other)
```

If `./certs/fullchain.pem` and `./certs/privkey.pem` already exist, setup offers to use them automatically. Otherwise it prompts for certificate/key paths.
When using `./certs/*`, setup also asks whether Let's Encrypt auto-renew should stay enabled.

You can also place files in `./certs/` manually:

```bash
# Copy certificates
mkdir -p certs
cp /path/to/fullchain.pem certs/fullchain.pem
cp /path/to/privkey.pem certs/privkey.pem

# Optional: point directly to host-level Let's Encrypt files in .env:
TLS_CERT_PATH=/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem
TLS_KEY_PATH=/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem
```

### Option 3: Self-Signed (Testing Only)

During setup, choose:

```bash
3) Generate a self-signed certificate (testing only)
```

The script writes `./certs/fullchain.pem` and `./certs/privkey.pem`. **Do not use self-signed certificates in production.**

---

## Server Scaling

The number of API server replicas is controlled by `SERVER_REPLICAS` in `.env`:

```env
SERVER_REPLICAS=2
```

### Recommendations

| Concurrent Users | Recommended Replicas | Notes |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------|
| < 500 | 2 | Minimum for high availability |
| 500 – 1,000 | 3 | Good balance for most deployments |
| 1,000 – 2,000 | 4 | Each replica handles ~500 WebSocket connections |
| 2,000+ | 4+ | Scale horizontally; consider dedicated hardware |

**Note:** All replicas share the same MongoDB and Redis instances. Redis is required for multi-instance WebSocket synchronization — it ensures that live session events are broadcast to all connected clients regardless of which server replica they're connected to.

### MongoDB

A single MongoDB instance is sufficient for most Qlicker deployments (thousands of concurrent users). MongoDB 7's WiredTiger engine handles concurrent reads efficiently. The Docker Compose sets `--wiredTigerCacheSizeGB=1` by default; increase this if your server has more RAM:

```yaml
# In docker-compose.yml, under mongo service:
command: ["mongod", "--wiredTigerCacheSizeGB", "2"]
```

**When to add MongoDB replicas:** Only if you need high availability (automatic failover). For read scaling, a single MongoDB instance is typically sufficient because the application uses Redis for the most performance-critical real-time data path.

### Changing Replicas After Setup

```bash
# Edit .env
SERVER_REPLICAS=4

# Apply
docker compose up -d --scale server=4
```

---

## Initializing from Legacy Database

Use this flow when you are preparing the Fastify deployment to take over an existing Meteor-backed database.

Important operational rule: once you rewrite legacy image URLs to `/uploads/<key>`, that database copy is considered cut over to Fastify. The old Meteor app should no longer be treated as the active reader for that database because it does not serve the Fastify `/uploads/...` path.

### 1. Create a Dump of the Legacy Database

On the old server:
```bash
mongodump --uri='mongodb://host:port/qlicker' --out=/tmp/qlicker-dump
```

### 2. Transfer the Dump

```bash
# Copy the full mongodump output under production_setup/legacydb/
scp -r /tmp/qlicker-dump/qlicker user@server:/opt/qlicker/legacydb/qlicker
```

If your dump contains multiple database directories, copy the top-level dump folder instead and let the script choose the primary application database automatically.

### 3. Bring Up the Fastify Stack

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 4. Restore the Legacy Data

```bash
# Interactive restore + question-type migration
./init-from-legacy.sh
```

The script will:
1. Detect the dump directory in `./legacydb/`
2. Back up any existing data
3. Restore the legacy dump using `mongorestore --drop`
4. Run the question-type migration

### 5. Configure Storage in the Admin Panel

After the restore, sign in to the Fastify app as an admin and open **Admin -> Storage**.

For Amazon S3, enter:

1. bucket
2. region
3. access key ID
4. secret access key
5. optional endpoint
6. optional path-style toggle for S3-compatible services

Save the settings before running the sanitize step so the application knows how to read S3 objects through `/uploads/<key>`.

### 6. If You Are Keeping S3 Public for the Moment, Validate First

Before changing bucket privacy, confirm:

1. the Fastify app can log in against the restored database
2. a new image upload works from the profile page
3. a new image upload works from a rich-text editor

### 7. Run the S3 Sanitize Step When You Are Ready to Cut Over

If legacy image fields still contain direct public S3 URLs and you want Fastify to serve them from a private bucket, run:

```bash
./sanitize-s3.sh          # Dry run
./sanitize-s3.sh --apply  # Rewrite DB refs + attempt ACL privatization
```

Or, as a single maintenance-window command immediately after restore:

```bash
./init-from-legacy.sh --sanitize-s3
```

That option now runs the same sanitize workflow in apply mode after the database restore and question-type migration.

### 8. Final Validation Before Bucket Lockdown

After `sanitize-s3.sh --apply`, verify:

1. several old profile images load
2. several old question-editor images load inside question content
3. profile thumbnail regeneration still works
4. a brand new upload still works

---

## S3 Private-Bucket Migration

The legacy Meteor app stored direct public S3 URLs in MongoDB. Fastify now serves uploads through `/uploads/<key>` and reads the object from the configured storage backend. The cutover has two distinct parts:

1. rewrite the database references
2. remove public access from S3

Do not do part 2 first on the live bucket if Meteor is still serving traffic.

### S3-Side Preparation

Before the Fastify cutover window:

1. Identify the existing bucket name and region.
2. Create or confirm an IAM principal with `s3:PutObject`, `s3:GetObject`, and `s3:DeleteObject` on `arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET/*`.
3. Keep any current public-read bucket policy or object-access path in place until Fastify has been validated against the restored DB.
4. Decide whether you want to keep ACLs enabled temporarily. If you move directly to Object Ownership `Bucket owner enforced`, the sanitize script will still rewrite MongoDB URLs, but the ACL pass will be reported as skipped because S3 no longer accepts ACL writes.

### Dry Run

```bash
./sanitize-s3.sh
```

### Apply

```bash
./sanitize-s3.sh --apply --verbose
```

### What It Does

1. Reads S3 settings from the database `Settings` document, with `AWS_*` env vars available as overrides
2. Scans `users`, `images`, and `questions`
3. Rewrites matching legacy public S3 URLs to `/uploads/<key>`
4. Backfills `images.key` if needed
5. Collects the referenced S3 object keys
6. In `--apply` mode, attempts `PutObjectAcl(..., ACL=private)` for each discovered key when credentials are available

### Admin-Panel Requirements

The sanitize step assumes **Admin -> Storage** already points Fastify at the correct S3 bucket. Specifically, confirm all of the following before you apply it:

1. storage type = `Amazon S3`
2. bucket matches the legacy bucket
3. region matches the bucket region
4. access key ID and secret access key are valid
5. endpoint/path-style are set correctly if you use MinIO or another S3-compatible service

### Bucket Lockdown After Validation

Once Fastify is rendering old and new images correctly:

1. remove any public bucket policy or public website access that made the old URLs readable
2. enable **Block Public Access** for the bucket
3. optionally switch Object Ownership to **Bucket owner enforced**

At that point, the objects can remain private while Fastify continues to serve them from `/uploads/<key>`.

---

## User Management

The `manage-user.sh` script provides CLI access to common user operations:

### Change Password

```bash
./manage-user.sh change-password --email user@example.com --password newSecure123

# Auto-generate a password
./manage-user.sh change-password --email user@example.com
```

### Create User

```bash
./manage-user.sh create \
  --email prof@university.edu \
  --firstname Jane \
  --lastname Smith \
  --role professor \
  --password securePass123

# Roles: student (default), professor, admin
```

### Promote User

```bash
./manage-user.sh promote --email user@example.com --role admin
```

### Toggle Local Email Login for One User

```bash
# Allow local email/password login for one SSO-managed account
./manage-user.sh set-email-login --email user@example.com --enable-email-login

# Remove that exception again
./manage-user.sh set-email-login --email user@example.com --disable-email-login
```

### List Users

```bash
./manage-user.sh list
```

---

## Backups

`backup.sh` and `restore.sh` work against the MongoDB data in this deployment.
They use the Docker volume mapping in `docker-compose.yml`:
- host: `${BACKUP_HOST_PATH}` (default `./backups/`)
- mongo container: `/backups/`
- the backup manager container also mounts the same directory to write live dumps
- both `backup.sh` and `backup-manager.sh` append operational logs to `${BACKUP_HOST_PATH}/qlicker_backup.log`

### How `backup.sh` Works

When you run `./backup.sh`, the script:
1. Loads `production_setup/.env` for Docker access and backup-manager runtime settings
2. Verifies the `mongo` container is running
3. Runs `mongodump` against the live database using the configured `MONGO_URI` into `/backups/qlicker_backup_<timestamp>_<label>`
4. Compresses that dump to `backups/qlicker_backup_<timestamp>_<label>.tar.gz`
5. Deletes the uncompressed dump directory
6. Prunes `.tar.gz` backups by label using the retention counts stored in Admin -> Backup
7. Appends run details and errors (including captured command output) to `backups/qlicker_backup.log`

### Create a Backup

```bash
./backup.sh
```

Creates a timestamped, compressed backup in `./backups/`:
```
backups/qlicker_backup_20260321_020000_daily.tar.gz
```

`./backups` remains the operator-friendly path in `production_setup/`. If `BACKUP_HOST_PATH` points elsewhere, `setup.sh` creates `./backups` as a symlink to that host directory.

Inspect backup log history:

```bash
tail -n 100 backups/qlicker_backup.log
```

### Store Backups on Another Disk

Set `BACKUP_HOST_PATH` in `.env` to an absolute host path on the target disk (for example `/data/qlicker2/backups`). Then recreate only the backup-writing services:

```bash
docker compose up -d --no-deps --force-recreate mongo backup-manager
```

This updates the bind mount without restarting `server`, `client`, or `nginx`.

Recommended migration sequence:

1. Create a manual backup before changing paths.
2. Copy existing `qlicker_backup_*.tar.gz` archives and `qlicker_backup.log` to the new path.
3. Set `BACKUP_HOST_PATH` in `.env`.
4. Recreate `mongo` and `backup-manager` as shown above.
5. Run `./backup.sh --label manual` and confirm the new archive lands under `BACKUP_HOST_PATH`.

### Backup Methods

Qlicker supports three primary backup trigger paths:

1. **Admin UI (manual):** **Admin -> Backup -> Backup now**
2. **Scheduled service:** `backup-manager` in `docker-compose.yml`
3. **Host command line:** run `./backup.sh` directly in `production_setup/`

For command-line runs, you can choose a label explicitly:

```bash
# default label is daily
./backup.sh

# explicit labels for one-off archival runs
./backup.sh --label manual
./backup.sh --label weekly
./backup.sh --label monthly
```

If the Backup tab shows a stuck `running` request while the manager is unhealthy, use
**Reset backup state** in the Backup tab after fixing the service health issue.

### Automatic Backups (Backup Manager Service)

The `backup-manager` service in `docker-compose.yml` checks the configured backup time once per minute, runs daily backups every day, weekly backups on Sundays, and monthly backups on the first day of the month. It updates latest run metadata in MongoDB so the Admin Dashboard can show current state and warnings.

`backup-manager` uses the same `MONGO_URI` value as the API server. If you override `MONGO_URI` in `.env`, recreate `backup-manager` and `server` so both point to the same database.

Use the Admin Dashboard's **Backup** tab to:

- enable or disable the scheduled backup job
- choose the local backup time
- change daily, weekly, and monthly retention counts
- request an immediate run with **Backup now**
- reset a stuck manual request with **Reset backup state**
- confirm manager heartbeat, run status, and archive filename
- jump directly to the recovery guidance from the UI

### Optional Cron Backups (Legacy Path)

Use this only if you intentionally want host cron to trigger backups outside the built-in backup-manager schedule.

Add to your server's crontab:

```bash
# Daily at 2 AM
0 2 * * * /opt/qlicker/production_setup/backup.sh --cron >> /var/log/qlicker-backup.log 2>&1
```

`--cron` keeps output quiet and only prints errors, which is better for cron logs.

### Backup Retention

Backup retention is configured in the Admin Dashboard's **Backup** tab. By default, Qlicker keeps:

- the latest backup for each of the last **7 days**
- the latest backup for each of the last **4 weeks**
- the latest backup for each of the last **12 months**

Archives are clearly labeled by tier:

```text
qlicker_backup_20260321_020000_daily.tar.gz
qlicker_backup_20260323_020000_weekly.tar.gz
qlicker_backup_20260401_020000_monthly.tar.gz
```

### How `restore.sh` Works

When you run `./restore.sh`, the script:
1. Loads `.env` and verifies the `mongo` container is running
2. Lets you choose a backup archive interactively (or accepts a file path argument)
3. Requires an explicit `yes` confirmation (or `--yes` for scripted maintenance)
4. Extracts the backup archive into a temporary host directory
5. Copies the dump into the MongoDB container
6. Runs `mongorestore` through the configured authenticated `MONGO_URI` to replace current data
7. Cleans up temporary files

### Restore from Backup

```bash
# Interactive — pick from available backups
./restore.sh

# Specific backup file
./restore.sh backups/qlicker_backup_20260321_020000_daily.tar.gz

# Non-interactive confirmation for scripted maintenance
./restore.sh --yes backups/qlicker_backup_20260321_020000_daily.tar.gz
```

⚠️ **Warning:** Restore will drop the current database. The script requires you to type `yes` to confirm.

### Complete Recovery Workflow

Use this sequence when recovering a deployment after host failure, data corruption, or an operator mistake:

1. Copy the `production_setup/` directory and your most recent `backups/qlicker_backup_*.tar.gz` archive onto the replacement host.
2. Run `./setup.sh` if the host is new so `.env`, TLS, and Docker settings exist again.
3. Start MongoDB and Redis if they are not already running:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d mongo redis
   ```
4. Stop the public app containers so users are not writing new data during restore:
   ```bash
   docker compose stop nginx server client
   ```
5. Restore the selected archive:
   ```bash
   ./restore.sh backups/qlicker_backup_20260321_020000_daily.tar.gz
   ```
6. Start the full stack again:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
7. Verify recovery by checking `docker compose ps`, signing in as an admin, opening **Admin -> Backup**, and confirming recent courses, sessions, and user data look correct.

If you also rely on local uploaded files, restore the `uploads/` directory from the same recovery point before reopening the system to users.

### Duplicate Grade Cleanup

The backend now blocks duplicate grade identities for the same `{ userId, courseId, sessionId }`, but older databases may still contain legacy duplicates. The maintenance script lives at the repo root.

```bash
# Dry run
node scripts/dedupe-grades.js --mongo-uri "$MONGO_URI"

# Apply deletions after reviewing the report
node scripts/dedupe-grades.js --apply --mongo-uri "$MONGO_URI"
```

Run it from a checkout of the same Qlicker revision that matches the deployment. Use `--skip-index` only if you intentionally do not want the script to recreate the unique grade index afterward.

---

## Updating

### Standard Update

```bash
./update.sh
```

This will:
1. Create a pre-update backup
2. Pull latest images (or rebuild if using local builds)
3. Restart services with zero downtime (rolling restart)
4. Run a health check

### Enabling MongoDB and Redis Authentication on an Existing Live Deployment

After copying this updated `production_setup/` directory onto a server that is already running Qlicker, use the dedicated migration script:

```bash
chmod +x *.sh
./enable-db-auth.sh
```

What the script does:

1. Creates a fresh `manual` MongoDB backup with `./backup.sh --label manual`
2. Stores safety copies of the current `.env` and `docker-compose.yml` under `backups/auth-migration-<timestamp>/`
3. Prompts for the built-in MongoDB admin username (default `qlickerAdmin`)
4. Reuses the existing MongoDB/Redis passwords if present, or generates strong new passwords with `openssl rand -hex 32`
5. Rewrites `.env` with:
   - `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME`
   - `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD`
   - authenticated `MONGO_URI`
   - `REDIS_PASSWORD`
   - authenticated `REDIS_URL`
6. Stops the stack, removes the old `mongo-data` and `redis-data` Docker volumes, and starts fresh authenticated `mongo` + `redis` containers
7. Restores the backup into the new authenticated MongoDB volume
8. Starts the full application stack again

Recommended maintenance-window procedure:

1. Copy the updated `production_setup/` files to the server.
2. Review any local customizations in `.env` and `docker-compose.yml`.
3. Run `./enable-db-auth.sh`.
4. After it completes, confirm:
   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   docker compose logs --tail=100 mongo redis server
   curl -k https://your-domain.example/api/v1/health
   docker exec "$(docker compose ps -q redis | head -1)" redis-cli ping    # should fail with NOAUTH
   ```
5. Keep the generated backup archive and the `backups/auth-migration-<timestamp>/` directory until you are satisfied with the migration.

The bundled CSP allowlist covers Qlicker itself, the default Jitsi SaaS domains (`meet.jit.si`, `*.jit.si`), and the built-in rich-text video embed providers. If you use a self-hosted Jitsi deployment or another external iframe/script source, extend `nginx/nginx.conf` before redeploying.

If the migration is interrupted, use the saved `.env` / `docker-compose.yml` snapshots plus the fresh backup archive noted by the script to recover manually.

### Force Rebuild from Source

```bash
./update.sh --build
```

### Skip Pre-Update Backup

```bash
./update.sh --no-backup
```

### Building Docker Images

From the repository root (where you have the source code):

```bash
# Build and tag
./scripts/build-images.sh --tag v2.0.0

# Build, tag, and push to a registry
./scripts/build-images.sh --tag v2.0.0 --registry ghcr.io/yourorg --push
```

`production_setup/docker-compose.yml` already uses pre-built images. You can override the default tags in `.env` and set the runtime release label:

```env
SERVER_IMAGE=ghcr.io/yourorg/qlicker-server:v2.0.0
CLIENT_IMAGE=ghcr.io/yourorg/qlicker-client:v2.0.0
APP_VERSION=v2.0.0.b1
```

Storage backend selection and cloud credentials are **not** read from environment variables at runtime anymore. The app boots with local storage by default; after the first admin signs in, configure **Admin -> Storage** to keep using local storage or switch to S3/Azure. The database `Settings` document is the source of truth.

The one storage-related maintenance exception is [`sanitize-s3.js`](./sanitize-s3.js) / [`sanitize-s3.sh`](./sanitize-s3.sh): they resolve S3 settings from the database first and accept `AWS_*` variables as overrides when needed.

## Monitoring & Logs

### View Logs

```bash
# All services
docker compose logs -f

# Specific service
docker compose logs -f server
docker compose logs -f nginx
docker compose logs -f mongo
```

### Health Check

```bash
curl -k https://your-domain.com/api/v1/health
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-21T...",
  "websocket": true,
  "redis": true
}
```

### Service Status

```bash
docker compose ps
```

### Resource Usage

```bash
docker stats
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Services won't start

```bash
# Check Docker Compose config is valid
docker compose config

# Check specific service logs
docker compose logs server
docker compose logs nginx
```

### Certificate errors

Ensure your domain's DNS A record points to the server. Check Certbot logs:
```bash
docker compose logs certbot
```

### WebSocket connection failures

If WebSocket connections fail behind a corporate firewall or CDN, ensure:
1. Your load balancer/CDN supports WebSocket upgrade
2. The connection timeout is at least 60 seconds
3. Check Nginx logs: `docker compose logs nginx`

### Database connection errors

```bash
# Check MongoDB is running and healthy
docker compose ps mongo
docker compose logs mongo

# Test connection from server container
docker exec $(docker compose ps -q server | head -1) \
  node -e "import('mongoose').then(m => m.default.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI).then(() => { console.log('OK'); process.exit(0); }))"
```

### Out of disk space

Check backup directory size and prune old backups:
```bash
set -a; . ./.env; set +a
du -sh "${BACKUP_HOST_PATH:-./backups}/"
# Reduce retention or manually remove old backups
rm "${BACKUP_HOST_PATH:-./backups}"/qlicker_backup_2026*.tar.gz
```

### Performance tuning

For high-traffic deployments:

1. **Increase server replicas** in `.env`
2. **Tune MongoDB cache** with `MONGO_WIREDTIGER_CACHE_SIZE_GB`
3. **Keep Mongo connection pools conservative** with `MONGO_MAX_POOL_SIZE`
4. **Increase Redis memory**: edit `docker-compose.yml` → `maxmemory`
5. **Enable swap** on the host to handle memory spikes
6. **Use an SSD** for MongoDB data volume
