# Developer Documentation

This documentation covers the active React + Fastify application.

## Recommended reading order

1. [Repository README](../../README.md) for setup and commands.
2. [Coding standards](../../CODING_STANDARDS.md) and [agent guide](../../AGENTS.md) for contribution requirements.
3. [Architecture](architecture.md) for system boundaries and request/realtime flow.
4. [Development guide](development-guide.md) for implementation and verification workflows.
5. [Data model](data-model.md) before changing persisted data.
6. [API reference](../api-reference.md) for OpenAPI and WebSocket documentation.
7. [Grading internals](grading.md) when changing scores, attempts, reviewability, or feedback.

Read the [legacy database reference](../../meteorjs_migration/LEGACY_DB.md) before changing schemas, IDs, or migration/repair utilities. The other migration files are primarily historical/status context, not day-to-day architecture guidance.

## Validation baseline

From the repository root:

```bash
npm test --prefix server
npm test --prefix client
npm run build --prefix client
./scripts/qlicker.sh e2e
```

Not every change needs every suite during iteration, but the final validation should match the risk. Route/model/auth/grading work normally needs server tests; React behavior needs client tests/build; cross-role workflows need Playwright.
